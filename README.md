# ὁδός
This is a group of developers and other professionals involved in Tech Industry that want to use their vocation to make the World a better place.

The word **ὁδός** means "the Way", we wanna make our life a sign of a better way of life: a life of love and sacrifice for others.

In the Acts chapter 24:14-15, those who followed Christ were called "followers of the Way". 
Christ, the greatest revelation of Love and Sacrifice, called himself the Way in John 14:6.
